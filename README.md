- **Curated Psychedelic Art**: A library of 10+ high-definition images featuring ethereal character silhouettes and cosmic fractals.
- **Sonic Sanctuaries**: Integration of deep, calming ambient soundscapes designed for relaxation and focus.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile, with high-DPI support for crisp visuals.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Click **Initialize** to enter the immersive mode.
3. Use the **Complexity Bar** (bottom) to change the fractal density.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Unlike traditional "trippy" visualizations that can be overstimulating, MycoVision focuses on **calmness**. It uses slow zoom speeds, soft transitions, and deep ambient pads to create a meditative digital environment.
